 # Measuring the Power of an Earthquake.

 
 Earthquakes are recorded by a seismographic network. Each seismic station in the network measures the movement of the ground at that site. The slip of one block of rock over another in an earthquake releases energy that makes the ground vibrate. That vibration pushes the adjoining piece of ground and causes it to vibrate, and thus the energy travels out from the earthquake in a wave.
 
 There are many different ways to measure different aspects of an earthquake:
 
 **Magnitude** is the most common measure of an earthquake's size. It is a measure of the size of the earthquake source and is the same number no matter where you are or what the shaking feels like. The Richter scale is an outdated method for measuring magnitude that is no longer used by the USGS for large, teleseismic earthquakes. The Richter scale measures the largest wiggle (amplitude) on the recording, but other magnitude scales measure different parts of the earthquake. The USGS currently reports earthquake magnitudes using the Moment Magnitude scale, though many other magnitudes are calculated for research and comparison purposes.
 
 **Intensity** is a measure of the shaking and damage caused by the earthquake; this value changes from location to location.
 
 ## Magnitude / Intensity Comparison
 The following table gives intensities that are typically observed at locations near the epicenter of earthquakes of different magnitudes.
 
 Magnitude          Typical Maximum
                    Modified Mercalli Intensity
 ---
 1.0 - 3.0              I
 ---
 3.0 - 3.9              II - III
 ---
 4.0 - 4.9              IV - V
 ---
 5.0 - 5.9              VI - VII
 ---
 6.0 - 6.9              VII - IX
 ---
 7.0 and higher         VIII or higher

 Abbreviated Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale
 **I.** *Not felt except by a very few under especially favorable conditions.*
 
 **II.** *Felt only by a few persons at rest, especially on upper floors of buildings.*
 
 **III.** *Felt quite noticeably by persons indoors, especially on upper floors of buildings. Many people do not recognize it as an earthquake. Standing motor cars may rock slightly. Vibrations similar to the passing of a truck. Duration estimated.*
 
 **IV.** *Felt indoors by many, outdoors by few during the day. At night, some awakened. Dishes, windows, doors disturbed; walls make cracking sound. Sensation like heavy truck striking building. Standing motor cars rocked noticeably.*
 
 **V.** *Felt by nearly everyone; many awakened. Some dishes, windows broken. Unstable objects overturned. Pendulum clocks may stop.*
 
 **VI.** *Felt by all, many frightened. Some heavy furniture moved; a few instances of fallen plaster. Damage slight.*
 
 **VII.** *Damage negligible in buildings of good design and construction; slight to moderate in well-built ordinary structures; considerable damage in poorly built or badly designed structures; some chimneys broken.*
 
 **VIII.** *Damage slight in specially designed structures; considerable damage in ordinary substantial buildings with partial collapse. Damage great in poorly built structures. Fall of chimneys, factory stacks, columns, monuments, walls. Heavy furniture overturned.*
 
 **IX.** *Damage considerable in specially designed structures; well-designed frame structures thrown out of plumb. Damage great in substantial buildings, with partial collapse. Buildings shifted off foundations.*
 
 **X.** *Some well-built wooden structures destroyed; most masonry and frame structures destroyed with foundations. Rails bent.*
 
 **XI.** *Few, if any (masonry) structures remain standing. Bridges destroyed. Rails bent greatly.*
 
 **XII.** *Damage total. Lines of sight and level are distorted. Objects thrown into the air.*
