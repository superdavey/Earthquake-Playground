 ### What Causes Earthquakes?
 
 
The Earth's surface is always moving even if you cannot feel it.  The Earth's crust is made up of pieces called Tectonic Plates.  Some are huge and some are relatively small (by planet scale standards).  The plates come together like a very rough jigsaw.  However they are always moving. Below is a map of the different tectonic plates.

 ### How Plates move
 
 The plates more against each other in four different ways.
 
 * Divergent: the plates move apart. Spreading ridges, basin-range.

 * Transform: shearing; plates slide past each other. Strike-slip motion.

 * Convergent: compressional; plates move toward each other.

 * Subduction: During convergent one plate slide beneath another.

 The four types of movement result in different changes to the Earth.  They build mountains, create valleys, expands, destroys or transforms land as it moves.

 The continual movement of plates means that the Earth is always changing underneath our feet even if we cannot notice the small changes.  However, when the plates move suddenly we can measure and record those changes.
