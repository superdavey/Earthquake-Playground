 # Predicting future gemorphic hazards.
 
 Press the **"Run my Code"** to access live Earthquake data.
 
 Knowing that earthquakes are a daily occurence on our planet, you will now develope a model to predict the most likely location of earthquakes over the size of 5.5 magnitude on the Richter Scale.
 
 ## Task:  Can you predict future earthquakes?
 
 In this task you will investigate whether you are able to predict a country or location that will experience a magnitude 5.5 or greater earthquake.
 * Your teacher will provide you with a time period for which you need to predict.
 * For the purposes of this activity you will pick an historical period.
 * However for a longer program your teacher may have you predict a time in the future.
 
 ### You will need to complete the following:
 
 1. State the time period that you will be predicting, for example: 2019, and provide a prediction based on what you have observed from the frequency data.
 2. Collate historical earthquake data. This data can be collected over a period of time. For example, you may choose a week period each month for the last two years.
 3. Record the collated data in a spreadsheet using either Numbers or Excel. The date should include at least the earthquake:
 * Date
 * Location
 * Size
 4. Create a graph of the collected data. You will need to consider the most effective graph type that will show the location with the most frequent earthquakes.
 5. Using your graph, propose a hypotheses on which location/region is most likely to experience a major earthquake in the future.
 6. Extension: Research the impact of the earthquake on the environment and people of the affected region.
 
 
 ## Collecting your own data
 
 Press the **"Run my Code"** to access live Earthquake data.

 Complete the fields to display data
 
 *Data is limited to 20,000 records if this exceeds this no data is returned.*
