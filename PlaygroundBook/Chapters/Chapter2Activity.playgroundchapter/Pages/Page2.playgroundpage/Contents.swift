 # Predicting future gemorphic hazards.
 
 (Press the "Run my Code" to access live Earthquake data.)
 
 As you have already learnt earthquakes are  a dailey occurence on our planet.
 You will know developed a model to predict the most likely location of earthquakes over the size of 5.5 magnitude on the Richter Scale.
 

 
 Task:  Can you predict future earthquakes?
 **You will work to predict a country or location that wille experience a magnitude 5.5 or greater earthquake.**
 1. State the time period that you will be predicting, for example: 2019, and provide a prediction based on what you have observed from the frequncy data.
 * Your teacher will provide you with a time period for which you need to predict.
 * For the purposes of this activity you will pick an historical period.
 * However for a longer program your teacher may have you predict a time in the following months.
 2. Using historical data: collating data for eathquakes.  The data con be collected over a period of time. For example, you may choose a week period each month for the last two years.  You need to develop a
 
 3. You will record the collated data in either numbers or excel.
 Record:
 * Date
 * Location
 * Size
 
 4. Use the data to create a graph.  You need to consider to most effective graph to show the location with the most frequent earthquakes.
 5. Using the data grpahs propose a hypothese on which location/region is most likely to have experinced a major earthquake.
 6 Extension: Research the impact of the earthquake on the enviorment and people of the affected region.
